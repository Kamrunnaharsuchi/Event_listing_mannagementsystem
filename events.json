    "title": "A Recent Chapter Begins: Celebrating the Convocation of CSE Graduates at University of Scholars",
    "description": "<p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/api/uploads/1747823707825-884282303.jpg\" style=\"font-size: 1rem; width: 1592px;\"></p><p data-start=\"443\" data-end=\"1015\">The air was filled with excitement, pride, and bittersweet emotions as the students of the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at the University of Scholars gathered for one of the most significant days of their academic lives — their convocation ceremony. Years of hard work, sleepless nights, group projects, coding marathons, lab exams, and vibrant campus memories culminated in this one glorious moment. It was a day not only to celebrate academic achievements but also to look forward with hope, courage, and determination to the future that lies ahead.</p><p data-start=\"1017\" data-end=\"1409\">The grand convocation ceremony was held at the university auditorium, elegantly decorated with the university's signature colors, banners, and floral arrangements. Proud parents, respected faculty members, invited guests, and university authorities were in attendance to honor and witness the formal graduation of hundreds of bright young minds ready to embark on their professional journeys.</p><p data-start=\"1411\" data-end=\"1855\">As the CSE graduates entered the venue in their academic regalia — black gowns with vibrant-colored hoods representing their faculty — there was a shared sense of pride that lit up the room. Friends embraced each other, families smiled with joy, and cameras clicked rapidly to capture memories that would be cherished for a lifetime. The ceremony was not just a formal event but a powerful celebration of resilience, growth, and transformation.</p><h4 data-start=\"1857\" data-end=\"1889\"><strong data-start=\"1862\" data-end=\"1889\">Opening of the Ceremony</strong></h4><p data-start=\"1891\" data-end=\"2385\">The event commenced with the recitation from the Holy Quran, followed by a welcome speech from the Registrar of the University. The Vice-Chancellor then delivered the opening address, in which he emphasized the importance of education, ethics, and innovation in shaping the leaders of tomorrow. He reminded students that while this marks the end of their academic journey at the University of Scholars, it is also the beginning of a Recent adventure filled with opportunities and responsibilities.</p><p data-start=\"2387\" data-end=\"2545\">\"The world needs problem solvers, innovators, and ethical leaders — and I am confident that our CSE graduates are ready to take on that challenge,\" he stated.</p><h4 data-start=\"2547\" data-end=\"2575\"><strong data-start=\"2552\" data-end=\"2575\">Faculty Reflections</strong></h4><p data-start=\"2577\" data-end=\"2990\">Professors and mentors from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering took the stage to share emotional reflections. They recounted the journey of this batch — how they overcame the sudden shift to online education during the pandemic, managed academic workloads, and collaborated on groundbreaking final-year projects. They praised the students’ creativity, discipline, and eagerness to push boundaries.</p><p data-start=\"2992\" data-end=\"3292\">Dr. Nafisa Karim, Head of the CSE Department, said, “This convocation is a testimony to your strength and dedication. We have seen you grow — from confused first-year students into confident engineers who can now contribute meaningfully to society. Be proud, but remain humble. Always keep learning.”</p><h4 data-start=\"3294\" data-end=\"3319\"><strong data-start=\"3299\" data-end=\"3319\">Student Speeches</strong></h4><p data-start=\"3321\" data-end=\"3720\">One of the highlights of the convocation was the valedictory speech delivered by the top-performing student from the department. With a voice trembling with emotion, the student thanked the faculty for their guidance, parents for their unwavering support, and friends for the unforgettable experiences shared over the years. She also encouraged her peers to remain passionate and never fear failure.</p><p data-start=\"3722\" data-end=\"3966\">“We wrote our first line of code in this department. We built our first applications here. Some of us even failed a few times. But we got back up. Because that’s what this place taught us — to be brave. Let us carry that spirit wherever we go.”</p><h4 data-start=\"3968\" data-end=\"4017\"><strong data-start=\"3973\" data-end=\"4017\">Award Distribution and Degree Conferment</strong></h4><p data-start=\"4019\" data-end=\"4390\">As the names of the graduates were called, each student walked across the stage to receive their certificate. The applause from the audience never waned — every single graduate was cheered for, regardless of their academic rank. The university also awarded medals and certificates of excellence to those who had shown outstanding academic or extracurricular achievements.</p><p data-start=\"4392\" data-end=\"4651\">There were loud cheers as students from various CSE batches hugged, posed for group photos, and shared stories of their campus lives — from coding in the lab until midnight to preparing for job interviews, and organizing tech fests, seminars, and hackathons.</p><p data-start=\"4653\" data-end=\"4843\">Some students wore badges with motivational phrases like “Code. Debug. Graduate. Repeat.” while others carried placards reading “Mission Accomplished” and “Hello World — I’m a Graduate Now!”</p><h4 data-start=\"4845\" data-end=\"4892\"><strong data-start=\"4850\" data-end=\"4892\">Family and Friends: The Silent Pillars</strong></h4><p data-start=\"4894\" data-end=\"5183\">It was a day of emotional moments, especially for the parents and guardians who had supported their children’s educational journeys from the very beginning. Many were seen holding back tears as they watched their children receive their degrees, a tangible reward for years of perseverance.</p><p data-start=\"5185\" data-end=\"5400\">“I saw her stay up nights learning Java, I saw her cry when her project crashed the night before submission, and today I saw her graduate. I cannot explain the pride I feel,” said the mother of a graduating student.</p><p data-start=\"5402\" data-end=\"5573\">Some families traveled from distant regions to be present at the ceremony, showing the deep-rooted cultural and emotional importance of academic milestones in our society.</p><h4 data-start=\"5575\" data-end=\"5625\"><strong data-start=\"5580\" data-end=\"5625\">Looking Back: A Journey Worth Remembering</strong></h4><p data-start=\"5627\" data-end=\"6037\">The University of Scholars CSE Department has always been known for its academic rigor and forward-thinking curriculum. This batch, in particular, has been part of significant changes in the department — from the adoption of online labs during COVID-19 to the introduction of AI and machine learning modules, from participating in international programming contests to developing real-world software solutions.</p><p data-start=\"6039\" data-end=\"6350\">For many students, the journey included internships in reputed companies, contributing to open-source projects, and publishing research papers. The convocation was not just a celebration of their academic results but a recognition of their entire journey of growth and contribution to technology and innovation.</p><p data-start=\"6352\" data-end=\"6533\">One graduate remarked, “This place taught me more than just programming. It taught me how to think critically, how to collaborate, how to solve problems — and how to never give up.”</p><h4 data-start=\"6535\" data-end=\"6582\"><strong data-start=\"6540\" data-end=\"6582\">Future Ahead: Dreams Beyond the Degree</strong></h4><p data-start=\"6584\" data-end=\"6917\">As the confetti settled and the graduation caps flew high in the air, it became clear that the future is limitless for these CSE graduates. Some have already secured jobs in top tech companies in Bangladesh and abroad, some are planning to pursue higher education or research, while others are preparing to launch their own startups.</p><p data-start=\"6919\" data-end=\"7234\">The university’s career development center was also praised for helping many of these graduates with job placements, resume building, and interview training. The spirit of entrepreneurship was evident in the stories of several students who had already started working on innovative tech solutions to local problems.</p><p data-start=\"7236\" data-end=\"7401\">The message of the convocation was clear — the world is evolving at an incredible pace, and these graduates are not just ready to face it; they are ready to lead it.</p><h4 data-start=\"7403\" data-end=\"7437\"><strong data-start=\"7408\" data-end=\"7437\">A Moment Etched in Memory</strong></h4><p data-start=\"7439\" data-end=\"7691\">The ceremony concluded with the national anthem, followed by a grand photo session with all graduates, faculty, and staff. The University of Scholars gifted each graduate a customized yearbook, a memento, and a message of hope from the Vice-Chancellor.</p><p data-start=\"7693\" data-end=\"7999\">While some tears were shed and heartfelt goodbyes exchanged, one thing was certain: this convocation would remain one of the most defining moments in the lives of the graduates. It was not just about receiving a degree — it was about celebrating a community, a shared journey, and a future full of promise.</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-start=\"8001\" data-end=\"8287\">As the sun set on the university campus, the laughter and chatter of Recently graduated engineers echoed through the halls one last time — but their legacy will remain, etched into the walls of the University of Scholars, and in the hearts of everyone who shared in this unforgettable day.</p><p><br></p>",

For the students, it marked the end of an incredible journey and the beginning of a promising future.</p><hr data-start=\"1275\" data-end=\"1278\"><h3 data-start=\"1280\" data-end=\"1320\"><strong data-start=\"1284\" data-end=\"1320\">The Stage Set for a Historic Day</strong></h3><p data-start=\"1322\" data-end=\"1593\">From the early morning hours, the University campus buzzed with excitement. Students arrived in their gowns and caps, cameras flashed everywhere, and laughter filled the air. For many students and their families, this was the most anticipated day in their academic lives.</p><p data-start=\"1595\" data-end=\"1921\">The event took place in the university’s main auditorium, which had been beautifully decorated for the occasion. Flags bearing the university emblem, floral arrangements, banners highlighting the accomplishments of the graduating class, and an elegant stage setup provided the perfect backdrop for such a prestigious ceremony.</p><p data-start=\"1923\" data-end=\"2309\">At the heart of the stage stood <strong data-start=\"1955\" data-end=\"1982\">Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher</strong>, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Scholars, a respected academic leader known for his vision, integrity, and contribution to higher education in Bangladesh. His presence made the event even more meaningful for the students, who looked up to him not just as an administrator but as a guiding force behind their success.</p><hr data-start=\"2311\" data-end=\"2314\"><h3 data-start=\"2316\" data-end=\"2357\"><strong data-start=\"2320\" data-end=\"2357\">A Ceremony of Dignity and Emotion</strong></h3><p data-start=\"2359\" data-end=\"2570\">The convocation began with the national anthem, followed by an opening address by senior university officials. As the ceremony proceeded, all eyes turned to the main highlight — the distribution of certificates.</p><p data-start=\"2572\" data-end=\"2859\">One by one, students from the CSE department were called to the stage. As each name echoed through the hall, loud cheers erupted from their friends and families. The graduates, dressed in academic regalia, proudly walked up to receive their certificates from <strong data-start=\"2831\" data-end=\"2858\">Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher</strong>.</p><p data-start=\"2861\" data-end=\"3151\">With a warm handshake and a few encouraging words, the Vice Chancellor handed over each certificate with a smile. For many, it was the first time meeting him personally. The moment was brief, yet powerful — a lifetime of effort acknowledged in a simple exchange of paper and mutual respect.</p><p data-start=\"3153\" data-end=\"3428\">Some students bowed in gratitude, others gave a salute or a quick handshake. A few could not hold back their tears. For the faculty watching from the front rows, this was the moment their mentorship bore fruit. For parents watching from the gallery, it was a dream fulfilled.</p><hr data-start=\"3430\" data-end=\"3433\"><h3 data-start=\"3435\" data-end=\"3513\"><strong data-start=\"3439\" data-end=\"3513\">The Significance of Receiving the Certificate from the Vice Chancellor</strong></h3><p data-start=\"3515\" data-end=\"3892\">What made this ceremony especially memorable was that <strong data-start=\"3569\" data-end=\"3651\">each graduate received their certificate directly from Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher</strong> — a rare honor. In many institutions, such duties are often delegated to deans or department heads due to time constraints. However, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Scholars made it a point to personally hand over each certificate.</p><p data-start=\"3894\" data-end=\"4240\">This gesture reflected his deep commitment to student success. It wasn't just a ceremonial duty for him — it was an expression of pride in his students' accomplishments and the university's role in shaping future leaders. His presence elevated the entire experience, showing students that their hard work had been recognized at the highest level.</p><p data-start=\"4242\" data-end=\"4457\">One student later said, “When the Vice Chancellor handed me the certificate and said, ‘Well done,’ it felt like all those sleepless nights, projects, and stress were worth it. It was the proudest moment of my life.”</p><hr data-start=\"4459\" data-end=\"4462\"><h3 data-start=\"4464\" data-end=\"4507\"><strong data-start=\"4468\" data-end=\"4507\">Capturing Memories Through the Lens</strong></h3><p data-start=\"4509\" data-end=\"4818\">Professional photographers were present to capture every handshake and every smile. The stage became the scene of countless emotional and unforgettable moments — graduates receiving their certificates, parents clicking pictures, professors hugging their students, and friends high-fiving each other with glee.</p><p data-start=\"4820\" data-end=\"5160\">Many students posed with their certificates alongside <strong data-start=\"4874\" data-end=\"4901\">Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher</strong>, who graciously smiled in every photo, knowing these images would become cherished memories for generations. Later, outside the auditorium, the university arranged for group photos, food stalls, and a memory wall where students could write farewell messages.</p><hr data-start=\"5162\" data-end=\"5165\"><h3 data-start=\"5167\" data-end=\"5209\"><strong data-start=\"5171\" data-end=\"5209\">Voices of Gratitude and Aspiration</strong></h3><p data-start=\"5211\" data-end=\"5433\">Throughout the ceremony, the overwhelming emotion was one of gratitude. Graduates were quick to thank their teachers, mentors, families, and the university administration for supporting them through their academic journey.</p><p data-start=\"5435\" data-end=\"5753\">In her valedictory speech, a top-ranking CSE graduate said, “Receiving my certificate from Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher is a moment I will never forget. He has been an inspiration to all of us. This convocation is not just about academic success; it’s about the values we’ve learned here — discipline, respect, and vision.”</p><p data-start=\"5755\" data-end=\"6122\">Students recalled their time in the university — from their very first class in programming fundamentals to their final year projects in AI, web development, cybersecurity, and data science. They spoke of how the CSE department, under the guidance of passionate faculty members, had prepared them not just as engineers but as responsible professionals and innovators.</p><hr data-start=\"6124\" data-end=\"6127\"><h3 data-start=\"6129\" data-end=\"6183\"><strong data-start=\"6133\" data-end=\"6183\">A Leader Who Inspires: Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher</strong></h3><p data-start=\"6185\" data-end=\"6443\">Much of the event's emotional weight was carried by the presence and words of <strong data-start=\"6263\" data-end=\"6290\">Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher</strong>, whose keynote speech was both motivational and thought-provoking. He encouraged students to embrace the future with courage, curiosity, and compassion.</p><p data-start=\"6445\" data-end=\"6701\">“In today’s world, technology is not just a tool — it is a way of solving human problems,” he said. “As engineers, your duty is not just to write code or build systems, but to contribute to society, to make life easier, better, and more secure for people.”</p><p data-start=\"6703\" data-end=\"6906\">He urged graduates to continue learning, to never fear failure, and to stay grounded in values and ethics. His speech was met with a standing ovation, and many students were seen nodding with admiration.</p><p data-start=\"6908\" data-end=\"7118\">Dr. Basher also acknowledged the challenges the students had faced during their studies — including the global pandemic, online classes, and shifting job markets — and praised their resilience and adaptability.</p><hr data-start=\"7120\" data-end=\"7123\"><h3 data-start=\"7125\" data-end=\"7155\"><strong data-start=\"7129\" data-end=\"7155\">A Legacy of Excellence</strong></h3><p data-start=\"7157\" data-end=\"7502\">This graduating batch of the CSE Department had set a Recent benchmark in terms of academic achievement, research output, and innovation. Many students had already secured placements in top software firms, tech startups, and government IT sectors. Others were preparing to pursue higher studies in prestigious universities in Bangladesh and abroad.</p><p data-start=\"7504\" data-end=\"7585\">The Vice Chancellor proudly announced that this year’s graduating class included:</p><ul data-start=\"7587\" data-end=\"7805\">\n<li data-start=\"7587\" data-end=\"7651\">\n<p data-start=\"7589\" data-end=\"7651\">Multiple students who published international research papers.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"7652\" data-end=\"7687\">\n<p data-start=\"7654\" data-end=\"7687\">National-level hackathon winners.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"7688\" data-end=\"7727\">\n<p data-start=\"7690\" data-end=\"7727\">Contributors to open-source projects.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"7728\" data-end=\"7805\">\n<p data-start=\"7730\" data-end=\"7805\">Final-year projects adopted by local industries for real-world application.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p data-start=\"7807\" data-end=\"7959\">The ceremony was not just about the conferral of degrees but about acknowledging a generation that is ready to lead Bangladesh’s digital transformation.</p><hr data-start=\"7961\" data-end=\"7964\"><h3 data-start=\"7966\" data-end=\"7987\"><strong data-start=\"7970\" data-end=\"7987\">The Final Bow</strong></h3><p data-start=\"7989\" data-end=\"8238\">As the event drew to a close, emotions ran high. Students exchanged hugs, snapped final selfies, and wrote farewell notes on each other's gowns. The official ceremony ended with the national anthem and a final address from the university management.</p><p data-start=\"8240\" data-end=\"8524\">But the real takeaway was the bond that had been forged — between students and teachers, between knowledge and ambition, and between dreams and reality. The image of each student receiving their certificate from <strong data-start=\"8452\" data-end=\"8479\">Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher</strong> would forever remain etched in their memory.</p><p data-start=\"8526\" data-end=\"8832\">Outside the hall, laughter and cheer continued late into the afternoon as groups of graduates wandered through the campus one last time — stopping by their favorite classrooms, computer labs, cafeteria corners, and library halls. These were more than buildings; they were witnesses to their transformation.</p><hr data-start=\"8834\" data-end=\"8837\"><h3 data-start=\"8839\" data-end=\"8867\"><strong data-start=\"8843\" data-end=\"8867\">A Recent Journey Begins</strong></h3><p data-start=\"8869\" data-end=\"9221\">With their certificates in hand and dreams in their hearts, the graduates of the University of Scholars now stand at the edge of a Recent beginning. Whether they go on to become software engineers, data scientists, researchers, or entrepreneurs, one thing is certain — they will carry with them the values and spirit instilled in them by their alma mater.</p><p data-start=\"9223\" data-end=\"9455\">And in that defining moment — captured in hundreds of photographs — where each of them received their certificate from <strong data-start=\"9342\" data-end=\"9369\">Prof. Dr. Enamul Basher</strong>, the Vice Chancellor who believed in them — they stepped confidently into the future.</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-start=\"9457\" data-end=\"9600\">The University of Scholars salutes the graduating batch of CSE students. May their journey ahead be bright, impactful, and filled with purpose.</p>",

In traditional education, students often learn programming languages, data structures, algorithms, artificial intelligence, networking, and cybersecurity in a controlled classroom setting. However, the application of these skills in real-time projects, collaborative development environments, or mission-critical systems can only be fully appreciated when observed in professional settings. The tour was conceived to offer this vital insight.</p><p>\n\n\n</p><p data-start=\"1440\" data-end=\"1854\">While the <strong data-start=\"1450\" data-end=\"1495\">exact locations and partner organizations</strong> involved in the 2024 tour were not publicly detailed, such initiatives typically include <strong data-start=\"1585\" data-end=\"1623\">visits to leading technology firms</strong>, <strong data-start=\"1625\" data-end=\"1659\">software development companies</strong>, <strong data-start=\"1661\" data-end=\"1677\">data centers</strong>, <strong data-start=\"1679\" data-end=\"1701\">cybersecurity labs</strong>, and <strong data-start=\"1707\" data-end=\"1732\">research institutions</strong>.
